                    <p class="essay-example-desc"><strong>Why it's excellent:</strong> Orwell's essay is a masterclass in clear, direct writing. He argues that unclear language corrupts thought and politics.</p>

                            inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the
                            half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes."
